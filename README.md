## Design of behavioural aspects:
-Some things.
## Design Patterns:
1. Singleton - for the main game class (provisory).

# GUI Design
## Listing of the main functionalities:
1. The game will be playable in Single Player.
2. The game keeps scores of single player game runs.
3. The settings of the game will allow for a player to turn off the sound in the game.
4. The game will be able to share a post on Facebook upon player's request.

# Test Design
## Listing of the expected final test cases:
1. Test to the movement of the minion.
2. Test randomness of the platform.
3. Test out-of-bounds behaviour.
4. Test player losing.
5. Test randomness movement of the villain.
5. Test highscore saving.
