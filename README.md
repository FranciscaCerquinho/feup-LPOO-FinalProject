# Architecture Design

## Package and class diagram (UML), documenting (describing) each class' responsibility:

- ### Minion Jump
Encharge of game logic. This is the main class.
- ### Entity
This class defines all the characteristics common to all entities of the game.
- ### Villain
This class defines the behavior of the villain.
- ### Minion
This class defines the behavior of the minion (character moved by the user).
- ### Platform
This class define platforms where minion walks.


## Design of behavioural aspects:

## Design Patterns:
1. Singleton - for the main game class (provisory).

# GUI Design
## Listing of the main functionalities:
1. The game will be playable in Single Player.
2. The game keeps scores of single player game runs.
3. The settings of the game will allow for a player to turn off the sound in the game.
4. The game will be able to share a post on Facebook upon player's request.

# Test Design
## Listing of the expected final test cases:
1. Test randomness of the platform.
2. Test out-of-bounds behaviour.
3. Test player losing.
4. Test randomness movement of the villain.
5. Test highscore saving.
